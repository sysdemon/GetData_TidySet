=========================================

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate how to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

This includes:

1. a tidy data set (tidydata.txt) 

2. source code (run_analysis.R)

3. a code book (CodeBook.md)

4. README.md (this file)
